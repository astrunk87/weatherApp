# weatherApp
check the 5 day forecast for any city and state in the US


## Description


I wanted to create an app where I could easily search the 5 day forecast in cities around the US. With this app I am easily able to search any US city and see the 5 day forecast. I can also see my recent searches. Doing this project I learned how to better work the weather api and use any US city to search. I got a better handle on javascript and being able to write more functional code. I leanred a little more about daysjs as well.







## Usage

to use this app type in the city you want to look up then hit submit city.
type in the state that city is in then hit submit state.
you will see the city and state listed.
once you have the city and state listed hit search and you will be prestened with the 5 day forecast for that city and state.
it will bring brack the weather phrase, the high temp, the low temp, and what kind of perciption there might by, if its undefined, there is no perciption expected.
if you want to search for a new city and state, hit the new search button to clear out the current search.
you can also see what you have recently searched below the forecast.
