# weatherApp
check the 5 day forecast

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city





## Description


I wanted to create an app where I could easily search the 5 day forecast in cities around the US. With this app I am easily able to search any US city and see the 5 day forecast. I can also see my recent searches. Doing this project I learned how to better work the weather api and use any US city to search. I got a better handle on javascript and being able to write more functional code. I leanred a little more about daysjs as well.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

```md
